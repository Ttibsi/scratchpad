# Update Golang

To simply update golang from your terminal, run the following

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/go1.20@latest
go1.20 download
```

_nb: replace 1.20 with the version you want to install_

This will install the latest version of go to `$HOME/.go/bin/`

You will also need to set an alias or use the `go1.20` command invocation
as the standard `go` is set to the previous installed version
